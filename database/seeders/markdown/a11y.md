# E-commerce Accessibility Audit & Remediation
> Achieved WCAG 2.2 AA compliance for a lifestyle DTC brand in six weeks.

## TL;DR
- Fixed **397** a11y issues across 42 templates
- Added semantic React headless-UI components â†’ **+18 % conversion on mobile**
- Passed third-party audit with zero critical fails ðŸŽ‰

---

## 1 Â· Context
The clientâ€™s Shopify-Plus storefront relied on heavily customised Liquid and jQuery plugins that broke for screen-readers and keyboard users.

## 2 Â· Assessment
- **Automated scan** (Axe-core CI) â€“ 221 violations
- **Manual review** with NVDA & VoiceOver
- **Keyboard walk-through** to flag focus traps

> Critical issues: carousel keyboard trap, insufficient contrast on sale badges (< 2.8:1), missing form labels.

## 3 Â· Fix strategy
1. **Component refactor**
    - Swapped custom dropdowns â†’ Headless-UI `Listbox`, preserving styles.
    - Added Tailwind `focus-visible:ring-2` for all interactive elements.
2. **Color remediation**
    - Introduced `brand-800` for text on `brand-100` backgrounds.
3. **Testing pipeline**
    - GitHub Action runs Axe on every PR; fails build if severity â‰¥ serious.

## 4 Â· Outcomes
| KPI | Pre | Post | Note |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| Mobile CR (all traffic) | 2.1 % | **2.48 %** | +18 % |
